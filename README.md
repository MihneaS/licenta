# 3D physics engine with microcollisions

This is the project that my BA thesis is based on. 
It's a 3D physics engine with microcollisions based on Ian Millingon's book "Game physics engine development". 
It uses microcollisions to simulate contacts, meaning that each contact is simulated independently from each other, worst contacts first, 
and resolved with an linear and an angular impulse at the contact point. 
If needed, the same point may be corrected more then once per frame. 
This results in an fast and visually credible simulation.
